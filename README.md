Matan 12 project code stuffs

Hi there! Welcome to Noah, Devin, & Laisyn's grade 12 computer engineering project!

This project is intended to be a robotic chess/checkers/tic-tac-toe board, featuring:
- A  circuit matrix piece detection system powered by a raspberry pi 3 
- A 3-axis CNC-inspired electromagnet on a stick to move pieces powered by a raspberry pi zero w
- A built-in software game engine powered by Noah's laptop
- And some sweet TCP networking to get all these pieces to talk to each other wirelessly (plus some neat cross-langauge comms!)

This project is coded in Python 3 and Java 8.
We use the IntelliJ IDEA for any and all Java programming & the default Python 3 IDE for Python code.
   
Feel free to grab any of this code & use it for your own similar purposes! 
However, if you use it and see any of us around, it'd be super cool if you bought us a coffee or something :)
Therefore, this software is under a Coffreeware License (see what I did there?)


Enjoy!
